# IIUM-Ride

Getting around the IIUM campus and its surrounding areas can sometimes be a challenge, especially for students and staff who do not own personal vehicles. Public transportation options may be limited, while ride-hailing services are not always practical or affordable for short, frequent trips. With this in mind, we propose IIUM Ride, a self-drive car rental system designed exclusively for the IIUM community, offering a convenient, affordable, and efficient solution to campus mobility.
IIUM Ride aims to provide students and staff with the ability to rent a car for a few hours or an entire day, depending on their needs. Whether it’s a quick trip to the Gombak LRT station, a grocery run to nearby shopping centres, or a weekend journey home, users can book a car through a user-friendly digital platform and drive themselves to their destination. This approach not only saves time but also empowers users with flexibility and independence in planning their schedules.
The self-drive concept is particularly valuable in a university setting, where schedules can be unpredictable, and shared transportation often fails to meet individual needs. With IIUM Ride, users will have access to a fleet of well-maintained vehicles, parked at strategic locations around the campus. Booking a vehicle is as simple as logging in, selecting an available car, choosing the duration, and confirming the reservation. Payment can be made online, promoting a smooth, contactless process that aligns with modern expectations of safety and convenience.
In the context of post-COVID-19 living, the system also addresses concerns about health and safety. Shared rides involve close contact with others, but self-drive rentals allow users to travel alone or with selected companions, reducing unnecessary exposure. Each vehicle will undergo regular cleaning and sanitation, ensuring a safe environment for every user.
Beyond mere convenience, IIUM Ride encourages responsible and sustainable usage of shared vehicles, reducing the number of underutilised cars on campus and promoting more efficient transportation. Instead of everyone owning a car, multiple users can access the same vehicle over time, contributing to a greener, more organised campus environment.
To further improve user experience, the system includes real-time updates on vehicle availability, in-app reminders for return times, and a rating system for users to provide feedback. Support is always within reach through the platform's integrated helpdesk, where users can report issues or request assistance with their bookings.
In conclusion, IIUM Ride’s self-drive system is more than just a rental service; it is a step forward in transforming campus life. By offering students and staff the freedom to move at their own pace, it addresses a growing need for flexible, safe, and efficient mobility within and beyond the university. With IIUM Ride, getting from point A to B becomes simpler, smarter, and more sustainable.
